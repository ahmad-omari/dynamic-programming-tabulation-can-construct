# Dynamic Programming Tabulation "Can Construct"

The function ‘canConstruct(target, wordBank)‘ that takes in a
target of String and array of String as arguments.

* The function returns a boolean indicating whether the target can be constructed by concatenating elements of the wordBank array.
* Using an element of the array multiple times is allowed.

# Complexity

Assume that:
m = target length
n = wordBank array length

Time Complexity is O(n * m^2)
Space Complexity is O(m)
